2- Explain 3 different CSS selectors.

	A- .class:
		eg: .class{
			}
		 is used in CSS to put all properties inside it, and any element in HTML that takes this class
		will have all properties inside that class
	B- element:
		eg: p{
			}
		This will make all <p> elements take all the properties given inside p{} in CSS

	C- hover:
		eg: something:hover{}
		This will make the properties inside hover{} apply to "something" whenever the mouse
		hovers over it.
